            <h1>My Austin, TX tour.</h1>
            <p>Hello, I'm Andrew Mihalevich, and I'm a stand up comedian. During spring break, I visited Austin, TX to perform on a number of stand up comedy shows and open mics. Here are the details of my trip.</p>

            <h1>Chortle Portal - Saturday March 4th, 2017</h1>
            <p>Chortle Portal was a fun indie show in the basement of an apartment building. There is no way it was up to fire code, but it was a lot of fun nonetheless. The crowds at this show were definitely the target audience for my style of comedy. The rest of the week is just downhill from here.</p>

            <h1>Nasty's Open Mic - Saturday March 4th, 2017</h1>
            <p>Did this open mic after Chortle Portal. It was in a fun little dive bar. I went up second to last, and I was afraid no one would be paying attention, but my set went well. PBRs were too expensive though.</p>

            <h1>Coldtowne Open Mic - Monday March 6th, 2017</h1>
            <p>Coldtowne is a neat little comedy theater that does improv, sketch, and stand up. The theater is a small little black box type stage. The crowd was small, but they were very responsive.</p>

            <h1>Cherrywood Open Mic - Tuesday March 7th, 2017</h1>
            <p>Cherrywood Open Mic takes place inside a coffee shop where there are a lot of people busy working on various things, and it feels very weird to just start telling jokes on a mic in the middle of people focused on something much more important. It was still a pretty fun mic anyway. I tried some new stuff and it went well.</p>

            <h1>Buzzkill at Buzzmill - Wednesday March 8th, 2017</h1>
            <p>This was a very cool venue. It was outdoors, but the stage area was covered. I thought that would be a bad thing, but they really packed the place out, and the sound was great. The only problem is that I thought I saw the light meaning my time was up, but I was wrong, and I ended up doing way less time than I was supposed to. Oops!</p>

            <h1>Hops and Grain - Thursday March 9th, 2017</h1>
            <p>This show was in a very spacious brewery taproom which lead to a large audience, and bad acoustics. I felt most confident in my material this night, even if I was met with a lot of blank stares. My drinks were on the house that night as compensation for the show. Not the worst deal.</p>

            <h1>Gourdough's Open Mic - Thursday March 9th, 2017</h1>
            <p>Went to this open mic after my Hops and Grain show. It was a very busy bar, and people were not paying attention to comics at all. Went up anyway, and had a lot of fun shouting into the void. I ordered a whiskey ginger ale, but later found out they didn't have ginger ale, and was instead mixing coke and sprite. I knew it tasted weird. I was mad at the bartender until she told me I had a good set.</p>

            <h1>Live at Coldtowne - Friday March 10th, 2017</h1>
            <p>My last show in Austin! Back at Coldtowne! It did not go well! The audience was very stingy about their laughter, and I did not help that by doing a bit that totally failed right at the beginning. Also professional touring comedian Shane Mauss was on the show, so I had to deal with him seeing that. Oh well!</p>
