            During spring break, I visited Austin, TX to perform on a number of stand up comedy shows and open mics. Here are the details of my trip.

            <h1>Chortle Portal - Saturday March 4th, 2017</h1>
            <p>Chortle Portal was a fun indie show in the basement of an apartment building. There is no way it was up to fire code, but it was a lot of fun nonetheless. The crowds at this show were definitely the target audience for my style of comedy. The rest of the week is just downhill from here.</p>

            <h1>Nasty's Open Mic - Saturday March 4th, 2017</h1>
            <p>Did this open mic after Chortle Portal. It was in a fun little dive bar. I went up second to last, and I was afraid no one would be paying attention, but my set went well. PBRs were too expensive though.</p>

            <h1>Coldtowne Open Mic - Monday March 6th, 2017</h1>
            <p>Coldtowne is a neat little comedy theater that does improv, sketch, and stand up. The theater is a small little black box type stage. The crowd was small, but they were very responsive.</p>

            <h1>Cherrywood Open Mic - Tuesday March 7th, 2017</h1>
            <p>Cherrywood Open Mic takes place inside a coffee shop where there are a lot of people busy working on various things, and it feels very weird to just start telling jokes on a mic in the middle of people focused on something much more important. It was still a pretty fun mic anyway. I tried some new stuff and it went well.</p>

            <h1>Buzzkill at Buzzmill - Wednesday March 8th, 2017</h1>
            <p>This was a very cool venue. It was outdoors, but the stage area was covered. I thought that would be a bad thing, but they really packed the place out, and the sound was great. The only problem is that I thought I saw the light meaning my time was up, but I was wrong, and I ended up doing way less time than I was supposed to. Oops!</p>
