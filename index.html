        <h1>Chortle Portal - Saturday March 4th, 2017</h1>
        <p>Chortle Portal was a fun indie show in the basement of an apartment building. There is no way it was up to fire code, but it was a lot of fun nonetheless. The crowds at this show were definitely the target audience for my style of comedy. The rest of the week is just downhill from here.</p>

        <h1>Nasty's Open Mic - Saturday March 4th, 2017</h1>
        <p>Did this open mic after Chortle Portal. It was in a fun little dive bar. I went up second to last, and I was afraid no one would be paying attention, but my set went well. PBRs were too expensive though.</p>
